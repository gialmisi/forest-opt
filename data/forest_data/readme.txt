Description of most of these indicators can be found in:
Kyle Eyvindson, Anna Repo, Mikko Mönkkönen 2018. Mitigating forest biodiversity and ecosystem service losses in the era of bio-
based economy. Forest policy and economics


Also for Income and harvested pulpwood / logwood, periodic incomes or harvests, indicated by period (0,1,2 ... 19)

Data organized by column and rows --
    :columns are management type (predefined actions in the forest stand over time)
    :rows are individual stands.
    
    Empty cells indicate infeasible management type for that specific stand. Due to limitations caused by initial stand conditions.

These indicators can be used independently, or connected through meta-indicators. Income could be examined through a Net Present value (with a fixed or varied discount rate)
The habitat suitability indicators can be grouped together (such as CHSI), or through a multi-functionality measure (minimize distance between a set of criteria).
